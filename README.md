# Introduction 

Every year, over 180,000 non-EU nationals (like myself) apply for a work or student visa to come to the United Kingdom. These indivduals are highly skilled workers, enterpreneurs, sportpersons, etc. Typically the application process involves proving to the Home Office that the visa is intended to fill a technical gap in the country, which might involve showing that the job is in the shortage occupations list or passing through a residents labours market test. A complete list of companies that sponsor or have sponsored work visas can be found here. 
 
The present dashboard shows the evolution of legal work immigration since 2005. It is based on freely available official This interactive visualisation accounts for statistics of legal immigration in the UK. The points-based system visa has been introduced in 2005 and fully implemented in 2008 and coincides with a drop of more than 37\% in the total work visas. Since 2009, the UK started a policy called [hostile enviroment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office_hostile_environment_policy).
